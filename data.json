    "Semester Recap and Prep": "\ufeffThe goal of this document is to summarize the progress CRCloud has made this past semester and all the work that has been done, as well as prepare for next semester and the joining of new members.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecap:\r\n* The completion of the Weekly Reminder API\r\n   * Java finished implementing the specific functions of the API, such as create, edit, and delete.\r\n   * Now, members can easily use these functions to handle and use the Weekly Reminder bot.\r\n   * Context: When the Weekly Reminder bot used to post its reminders, none of the members were able to edit or delete them. This is because of the way member permissions coincided with the bot\u2019s permissions on Slack. As a solution, we decided to create API functions that we could use to call on the bot itself and commit those changes.\r\n* CRChat\r\n   * When brainstorming possible projects for us after the Weekly Reminder bot, we settled on CRChat, an easy-to-use chatbot specialized in everything CRC and combat robotics related.\r\n   * Value Proposition: CRChat would be directly integrated into our Slack, allowing users to easily ask it questions in a DM. It could also be pinged in other channels to have it respond to questions there. CRChat would be more useful than other popular chatbot options, such as ChatGPT, because it is already based on popular LLM models and specially trained in combat robotics/CRC. There are niches only CRChat would understand and be able to help with.\r\n* Implementation of CRChat\r\n   * First, we experimented with Meta\u2019s open-source model Llama on our local computers. It was to get a sense of what we wanted to build and how it would be utilized.\r\n   * Shao uploaded the local Llama model to the AWS cloud, testing to see if we could use it non-locally. (The vision of CRChat would have the model hosted on AWS, and we send requests on the cloud to that model.) This took quite a bit of debugging and troubleshooting.\r\n   * Research was done into the exact pipeline and workflow of CRChat. In the November-December document, we drafted a preliminary version of the entire process:\r\n1. User asks a message on Slack to CRChat.\r\n2. Send that request to API Gateway, temporarily storing user inputs in an S3 bucket for easy access.\r\n3. Invoke the Lambda function, which queries the hosted Llama model and returns the output.\r\n4. API Gateway returns the Lambda response to Slack, which is posted as a response to the user\u2019s question.\r\n   * Evan created the CRChat Slack app and enabled DM messages to be able to be sent, preparing for input submission.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor next semester:\r\n* Finalize hosting a model on the cloud, if not done yet.\r\n* Onboard new members, explaining the project\u2019s goal and past progress.\r\n* Get familiar with the tech stack and tools/resources we will be using.\r\n* Implement the pipeline.",

Model Hosting on Lambda\r\n   1. Since AWS Lambda has a memory limit (up to 10 GB), consider packaging a smaller version of the model (e.g., a distilled or fine-tuned variant of Llama 3.2).\r\n   2. May need to package dependencies carefully. Use AWS Lambda Layers for model dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, Transformers library).\r\n   3. Deploy the Lambda function in a compatible language runtime, such as Python.\r\n2. User Input Handling, two options\r\n   1. Create a Slack app that sends user queries to the backend.\r\n   2. For a web app, set up an input field and button for user submission, directing queries to API Gateway.\r\n3. Processing the Input\r\n   1. Use AWS API Gateway as the interface between user input and the Lambda function.\r\n   2. Configure API Gateway to receive requests from the Slack app or web app, validating and forwarding these requests in JSON format to the Lambda function.\r\n   3. Initially, we will simply store the user input on the cloud in a S3 bucket. This will allow us to access these prompts easily from other AWS services.\r\n4. Lambda Execution\r\n   1. Lambda receives JSON input, processes it, and calls the Llama model. Process and return the chatbot response in JSON format.\r\n   2. For performance, limit the model's response size or summarize output if lengthy.\r\n5. Event Coordination (Optional)\r\n   1. If you need more flexibility in routing or managing responses (e.g., retries, complex workflows), AWS EventBridge could be added to trigger Lambda based on events. This is helpful if other AWS services are involved or if we anticipate multiple event sources.\r\n6. Returning the Response\r\n   1. API Gateway returns the Lambda response to the originating app (Slack or web app).\r\n   2. For Slack, handle the response as a message reply. For a web app, display the response in a chat UI.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey AWS Services Summary\r\nLambda: Model hosting and response generation.\r\nAPI Gateway: Request routing.\r\nEventBridge (optional): Event management, if needed.\r\nS3: Storing user input/prompts.",

The organizer sets the channel, token, and message for the reminder in the generalized weekly report lambda function. It does this by taking in the event parameters when the API is called. This organizer function also sets up a new schedule with all the required parameters filled up using boto3\u2019s create_schedule. So in theory, this organizer function should do 2 things: set up the event schedule for every week (or desired time) and set up the destination of the message and specify the sending bot.\r\n\r\n\r\nI just need more time to create the organizer function, i'm still getting the hang of using boto3\u2019s create_schedule and making event bridge schedules. The generalized weekly report function is done though. It works as expected. So almost done with the 4th out of 4 APIs. \r\n\r\nNext meeting, spend like 30 minutes finalizing the function. So put the payload in the test event rather than the code. Also make the other 3 functions (send, edit, delete) rely on event given info for slack channel and token rather than relying on the OS Environment. Finally, make an installation and documentation page for these 4 APIs, with the focus on the weekly report api. The installation guide should tell users how to install a token into their slack channel/organization and how to invoke our APIs (which is just pasting the invoke REST API url plus the ? plus the parameters.
