Set up the arena \n? Tested the main.py with just the corner detection \n? Seem to work better now\n? Realized before our connection to ground on Arduino is loose\n? Logically, the code still doesn't seem to work\n\n? Tested using sensor data\n? IMU is flip in the bot, so we have to take away the negative\n? Sensor itself become super inaccurate with robot drift\n? Ex. yaw value goes from 180 to 190 degree within 1 second of move and hitting\n? But algorithm and detection seem to behave well \n\n? Tested with 24-25 algorithm code\n? It appears to work better \n? But after clean the wheels, it no longer able to attack the enemies rapidly\n\n? Testing this year's code again\n\nCorner Detection:\n\nTesting:\n? auto save should always be on. PLEASE\n? image.size / 3 bug in Corner Detection is fixed\n? more testing to be done\n\nMechE:\n?
