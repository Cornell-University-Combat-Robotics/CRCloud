    "How-To_ Prototype Belt Lengths.txt": "How To Prototype Belt Lengths\n\nWhy should we prototype? \n\nWhile CAD is a very useful tool to model dimensions and positions of most things, belts are tricky because they have variable tension. In order to model this tension, we need to manually use trial and error before we can order any component which has belt axle holes in them. \n\nSetup:\n\nYou will firstly want to make sure you\u2019ve ordered the belts you intend to use, the axles around which the belt will rotate, and any other component which is integral to the structure of the belt system, like bearings, wheels, shafts, or motors. \n\nThe goal with this is to make sure your trial and error system is as close to your final product as possible, so as to better replicate the tension in the actual system.\n\nYou will additionally want continued access to a 3D printer, and PA6-CF or other similarly rigid filament.\n\nPrototyping:\n\nFirst, 3D print the upright as you have designed it in CAD based on the theoretical length and diameter of the belt.\n\nOf course, this will not be accurate the first time, but rather to use as a reference point for whether to adjust the axles further or closer.\n\nAssemble your system using the 3D printed upright, and use the tension in the belt in this setup to determine whether to increase tension by moving the axles further apart, or decrease tension, by moving them closer together.\n\nIf unsure, repeat the below steps for both larger and smaller increments.\n\nModel an Isaac Arc\u2122, similar to the one pictured below. The objective is to create an array of distances between the two axles in as small of a 3D printed object as possible, to save printing time and filament.",

Both these methods functionally have the same purpose in combat robotics, but there are slight differences between the two. Laser cutting is more precise than water jetting, as the minimum cut size for a laser cutter is .15mm, while a waterjet has a minimum cutting slit size of .5mm. However, laser cutters are typically only able to cut materials up to around 35mm thick, while a waterjet can cut through parts as thick as 300mm. Additionally, waterjet cutting is more flexible and can cut a wider range of materials, while laser cutting excels at cutting materials (including but not limited to) glass, metal, wood, and plastic but cannot cut reflective materials due to cutting via heat. \n\nLaser Cutting/Water Jetting Vendor List\n\n\n\nVendor Name\n\nLocation\n\nPros\n\nCons \n\nSendCutSend (2D parts)\n\nUSA\n\nVery fast shipping and turn around time, and one of the cheapest options\n\n\n\nHas most materials in most thicknesses\n\nOnly cuts 2D parts\n\n\n\nCertain materials like Carbon Fiber and Titanium are prohibitively expensive\n\n\n\nIs not good for tight tolerances, due to nature of water jetting\n\nFictiv \n\nUSA\n\nCan make 3D objects like billets\n\n\n\nFor parts with tight tolerances, they are very reliable\n\nMore expensive than SendCutSend and takes longer to send \n\nClark Machine Shop\n\nCornell Campus\n\nSuper quick, can drop stock off at Clark, can machine metals that Emerson cannot \n\nKinda expensive \n\n\n\n\n\nElectrical Discharge Machining\n\nInformation\n\nEDM is only used for parts whose designs demand tight tolerances, good surface finishes, undercuts, or other complex machining features.

    "How-To_ Battle Harden.txt": "How to battle harden your motors\n\n\tThis link leads to a video that gives a detailed video and an example for battle hardening. Battle hardening is the process of putting a glass microbe and epoxy mix between the magnets of motors so that the magnets will not shift and potentially shatter if the motor is hit.\n\nSAFETY: \n\nMake sure to wear a mask AT ALL TIMES when applying the glass microbe and epoxy mix. If you inhale a lot of the glass microbes you will get microplastics in your lungs and probably die from cancer :( \n\nWear gloves AT ALL TIMES when applying the glass microbe and epoxy mix. The stuff can get on your skin and it would be yucky because it would then become hard to peel off.\n\nWhen applying acetone, make sure that the cup you are putting the acetone in is resistant to acetone and will not get immediately melted. Acetone reacts with plastic and will literally melt through some cups so yeah.\n\nSTEP 1:\n\nTake apart each motor: The motors will have c-clips and shaft collars that will need to be taken off in order to pull apart the top and bottom in order to harden each piece. Another thing that will be on the motor is these golden ring things but you can just take those off and store them for later, they are basically just mini bearings for the motor. Be careful not to lose any parts!\n\nShaft collar:\n\nScrew these off using an appropriate allen key. If the screw is stripped and if you do not need the original shaft, you can use the drill press to take out the excess metal inside of the shaft collar. OR you can use the saw to saw off a large part of the shaft collar because the collar is made out of aluminum which is softer than steel.\n\nC-clips: \n\nWhen you take these off, make sure not to break them because it will be nice to have them later.\n\nSTEP 2:\n\nThe motor separated into top and bottom should look like the picture below:\n\nTOP:\n\n\n\nBOTTOM:\n\n\n\nMake the mixture: The video explains in a good way on how to measure out the mixture starting at 7:15.\n\nApply the mixture to the sections detailed in the video at 9:45. Make sure to quickly take off parts of the mixture before it dries so you save yourself some work scraping the rest off later on. The video goes into good detail so just watch that instead.\n\nSTEP 3:\n\nAfter the mixture has all been applied, all that is left is scraping the rest of the mixture off. Some useful methods are:\n\nUSE A BOXCUTTER to rub off excess material from the bottoms. This should be pretty easy, as all you have to do is find where the material is sticking out on the bottoms and cut it off.\n\nAPPLY ACETONE to the insides of the tops, especially because it is hard to get into the tops, especially with metal objects. A method that worked with us was to tape paper towels to the tips of popsicle sticks, and then dip it into the acetone and rub it on the magnets inside of the tops, but also make sure that you don\u2019t get acetone in-between the magnets.\n\nSCRAPE WITH A FLATHEAD SCREWDRIVER the insides of the tops; this will take off lots of excess material easily, especially after acetone has been applied and all of the material is loosened. However, you might encounter a problem with the excess little bits and material that are in the tops.\n\nUSING DOUBLE SIDED TAPE TO TAKE THE BITS OFF works really well. You can get masking tape and shove it into the tops and rub it around which will catch all of the bits and take it off.\n\nSPINNING THE MOTOR. You can try to put together the tops and bottoms and spin the motor over and over again which will also gradually take off excess material. This will make bits of material that you can also take off using double sided tape.\n\nSTEP 4:\n\nRepeat and suffer\n\nSTEP 5: \n\nWhen the motors are fully battle hardened, compare them to a control group of motors. The battle hardened motors can be a little bit rougher than normal, but they should be relatively smooth as well. \n\nThey should look a little something like this:\n\n\n\nReference the video as well to see how a good battle hardened motor should look like.\n\nYou are done! Time for therapy. Here is a useful website for free therapy options offered by Cornell Health.",

Use this before asking someone where to find something in Fusion! \n\n\n\nSketches\n\n\n\nWhy are my lines turning different colors and what do those colors mean? \n\n\n\nBlue: A blue line in your sketch means that the line (or shape) is unconstrained. This is what you will see when you first draw something in a sketch. \n\nUnconstrained or undefined means that that particular element in your sketch is free to move unpredictably. This is bad! You want all of your sketches to be fully defined so that they are not floating in space and so other people can understand why your sketch is shaped the way it is. \n\n\n\nBlue lines in Fusion. Note that there are two black lines, and those are defined by being coincident with the origin and being horizontal and vertical. \n\n\n\nBlack: A black line means that your sketch is defined or constrained using either the dimension tool or using other constraint methods, such as \u2018coincident,\u2019 \u2018horizontal,\u2019 or \u2018collinear\u2019 (as seen in the first picture below). This is good! You want all of your sketches to be fully constrained. \n\nSide note: If you apply a dimension and you get the error seen in the second picture (the one that says \u2018over-constrained sketch\u2019), that means that you\u2019re trying to apply a dimension to a sketch that is already fully defined\u2014aka, the dimension you\u2019re adding is both unnecessary and impossible to apply. A driven dimension is simply a reference dimension that you can look at but cannot edit. \n\n\n\nConstraints listed in the bar at the top of your screen while in sketch mode. \n\n\n\nAn example of a pop-up you\u2019ll get when you try to overconstrain a sketch. \n\n\n\nPurple: A purple line is a projected sketch. If you press \u2018p\u2019 on your keyboard while in sketch mode and select a face or a different sketch, then you can project an element onto your sketch plane. If the reference face or sketch updates, then your sketch should (typically) update with it. Be careful using projected sketches! If you then delete the reference face or sketch, then Fusion no longer knows where the projection came from, and you\u2019ll get a bunch of yellow lines, which is bad!\n\n\n\nProjecting the face of a cube onto your sketch plane. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting sketch in purple. \n\n\n\nYellow: A yellow line means that Fusion knows there is supposed to be a sketch element there, but it doesn\u2019t know where it came from. This is typically a result of misusing a projected sketch. If you have any yellow elements in a sketch, you must redefine them! Yellow sketches are bad. \n\n\n\nThis sketch is yellow because I deleted the cube that the projected face was referenced from. \n\n\n\nGreen: A green sketch indicates that the sketch is fixed. Generally, this is bad because other users will not understand how your sketch is defined. There are two ways that your sketch can be green: \n\nYou manually fixed the sketch: This happens when you right-click an element of the sketch and hit \u2018Fix/UnFix\u2019. Once it is fixed, it will not move. \n\nYou redefine the sketch plane of a projected sketch: If your sketch contains a projection and then you redefine your sketch plane, the new sketch will turn your projection into a fixed sketch. If you do this, you should delete the sketch and re-project it so it turns purple. \n\n\n\nWhat are parameters and why should I use them? \n\n\n\nUnder Modify \u2192 Parameters, you can add User Parameters, which are variables that you can use when defining your sketches. \n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a user parameter. \n\n\n\nWhen you make a sketch, you can then use this parameter as though entering a variable into an equation. \n\n\n\n\n\nAn example usage of a parameter. \n\n\n\nA dimension with an fx next to it means that it has been defined using a parameter. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a parameterized dimension looks like. \n\n\n\nSo why should I use parameters? \n\nParameters help people understand what your dimension means. Using the pulleyDiameter parameter will make more sense to someone looking at your sketch than just the number 2. \n\nParameters will make adjustments to your part file easy in the long run. If you have a parameter wheelDiameter that you use when defining your chassis, if the wheel diameter changes, you can easily change it in your parameters and you won\u2019t have to individually change 200 different dimensions in a bunch of different sketches. \n\nOther tips on using parameters: \n\nYou don\u2019t need a parameter for every single dimension. Be sure to use your parameters in an effective way that is easy to understand by someone looking at your part file. If it\u2019s a one-time dimension, like a fillet, a parameter probably isn\u2019t necessary. (But if you have a bunch of fillets that you want to be the same size, then it might be useful\u2026)\n\nGive your parameters names that other people will understand! Diameter is not a useful name. weaponPulleyDiameter is a useful name. \n\n\n\n\n\nMy sketch is yellow in the timeline\u2014what does this mean? \n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a yellow sketch in a timeline.\t\n\n\n\nThis could mean 2 things:\n\nYou have a projected sketch but Fusion can no longer figure out where the sketch is projected from (see the explanation on yellow lines above). \n\nYou have to redefine your sketch plane, which is necessary if you drew your sketch on a surface that no longer exists. \n\nRight click the sketch in the timeline. \n\nHit \u2018Redefine Sketch Plane.\u2019 \n\nClick a new plane on which your sketch should reside. \n\nThis could be an XY plane, YZ plane, XZ plane, a face of a body, or a construction plane that you made yourself. \n\nThe yellow should be gone now!\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizing a part file\n\n\n\nUsing the timeline\n\n\n\nThe timeline is the thing at the bottom of your screen: \n\n\n\n\n\nIt keeps track of the \u201coperations\u201d that occur in your part file, and the order in which it happens. \n\nThe gray bar that you see at the end of the timeline can be moved so you can essentially reverse time. This is useful if you realize that you need to do an operation before another operation (for example, adding a construction plane to use for the mirror operator). \n\n\n\nOrganizing your timeline into groups\n\nYou can organize your timeline into groups: \n\nSelect a bunch of operations with ctrl \u2192 right click \u2192 hit \u2018Create Group\u2019\n\nYou can then rename this group into something useful. \n\nSome examples of useful groups: \n\nFillet groups\n\nJoint groups\n\nHole groups\n\nCaveat: Unfortunately, there is no way to add a new operation to an existing group. The only way to do this is to delete your previous group and make a new group with the new feature. \n\n\n\nCapture design history\n\nWhen you upload a part into Fusion (from McMaster, maybe), it will not have a timeline. To ensure that you have a timeline before making changes to the parts: \n\nRight click the part name in the browser. \n\n\n\nSelect 'Capture Design History\u2019 at the bottom. \n\nNow you can begin editing! (If you want to.)\n\n\n\n\n\nLabeling your sketches\n\nDO IT! \n\nLabeling your sketches is essential for organization. It is helpful for you to remember when, where, and how you\u2019ve defined your part, and it\u2019s helpful to others who are trying to understand you CADding process. \n\nTo label your sketch: \n\nRight click your sketch in the browser. \n\nHit \u2018Rename\u2019. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizing an assembly\n\nWhat is a component? \n\nA component is a fancy word for a part. It can come from a variety of places: \n\nYou can insert a component from a part you made by right-clicking the part in the Data Panel (the place where the files are) and clicking \u2018Insert into Current Design\u2019. \n\nIt is not recommended that you edit the part in this assembly file! This is called editing in place, and it makes it extremely difficult for other people to understand how you constructed your part. You should only edit parts in your part files. \n\nYou can import a part from McMaster by downloading the file from the website, uploading it to Fusion, and inserting it into your design as described in the previous point. \n\n(It is possible to directly import a McMaster part from Fusion, but this is not recommended since it creates a base feature and you are unable to rename the part or easily use it in other files.)\n\nYou can create a component by selecting Create \u2192 New Component. \n\nA good example of using this feature is in the \u2018Chassis Assembly\u2019 in Benjamin Rimshot Johm, Esq.\n\nThis allows you to create your parts in the same file without having separate part files that are then inserted into the assembly. \n\nTo edit this component, make sure that it is activated in the browser by clicking the dot next to the component (see the picture below). \n\n\n\n\n\nAn activated component in an assembly. \n\n\n\nHow many assemblies, subassemblies, subsubassemblies, etc. should I have? \n\n\n\nA part file contains only the part and no components. \n\nThis is where editing should take place. \n\n\n\n\n\nA part file contains no components in the browser. \n\n\n\nAn assembly file should generally only contain components. \n\nYou should generally not make any edits to parts in an assembly file. \n\n(There are some exceptions to this rule. See \u2018Chassis Assembly\u2019 in Benjamin Rimshot Johm, Esq. for an example.) \n\nYou should label your assembly as \u2018Assembly\u2019 in the file name so other people know that it\u2019s an assembly (Fusion does not differentiate automatically between part files and assembly files.) \n\nUse sub-assemblies with care; do not make unnecessary sub-assembles. Having 1 sub-assembly per subsystem is typical. \n\n\n\n\n\nAn assembly file contains only components in the browser. \n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an example of part organization for a kinetic robot: \n\nFull assembly (contains components only)\n\nChassis assembly (contains components only, with exceptions)\n\nBillet\n\nUprights\n\nTop plate\n\nChassis screws\n\nEtc. \n\nDrivetain assembly\n\nWheel\n\nMotor\n\nGearbox\n\nPulley\n\nSpacers\n\nDrivetrain screws\n\nEtc. \n\nWeapon assembly\n\nWeapon blade\n\nWeapon shaft\n\nBearings\n\nSpacers\n\nPulleys\n\nEtc. \n\nBattery\n\nESCs\n\nWeapon motor (if not a hub motor)\n\nInter-subsystem screws\n\nConfigurations\n\n\n\nWhat is a joint and how do I use one properly? \n\n\n\nA joint positions components relative to each other in an assembly.\n\nTo joint components:\n\nMake sure they are components not bodies!\n\nClick the joint button in Assemble (or press \u201cJ\u201d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the place you want to join on the first component\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the place you want to join on the second component\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \u201cOK\u201d (or press \u201cEnter\u201d)\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to name the joint!\n\nClick the folder \u201cJoints\u201d\n\nDouble click the joint and name it according to naming convention\n\n[Name of component 1] to [name of component 2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have so many screws and small parts! How should I organize this?",
    "How-To_ Preload (for Spinning Weapon Assemblies).txt": "How to preload (for spinning weapons)\n\n\n\nProper preloading is an essential step when designing and assembling spinning weapons: with the right preload, a weapon stack can spin freely while remaining very strong against impacts. When the preload is too tight, the weapon doesn\u2019t spin freely, and when the preload is too loose, the bearings can shake themselves apart.\n\n\n\nThis preloading guide applies only to spinning weapons that rotate around stationary (\u201cdead\u201d) shafts, which are typically steel bolts. If you\u2019re designing or working with a different kind of spinning weapon, preloading may still be important, but you\u2019ll need to do more research to make sure you\u2019re applying it in the right way. Additionally, preloading is not essential for all bearing types, but for angular-contact bearings (ACBs), it is essential. This guide focuses on preloading with ACBs, using Rosie\u2019s weapon assembly as an example (labeled in the figure below).\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what is preloading anyway?\n\nA bearing is preloaded when there is a constant axial load applied to it by the assembly, as shown below. F1 is applied to the outer race, and F2 is applied to the inner race, forcing those races towards each other to keep the balls from being able to rattle. For ACBs like this, it\u2019s possible for the bearing to rattle itself apart at high speeds if there is no preload. \n\n\n\nHowever, too much preload can cause the bearing to seize up. If F1 and F2 are too large, the balls and the races will be squeezed tightly, forcing them to deform as they rotate. This causes unnecessary wear, and at high speeds, it can create enough heat to melt the plastic holder that keeps the balls in place. So we want to get F1 and F2 (the preload force) just right.\n\nHow do we get the preload force just right?\n\nShort answer: by sandwiching them with perfectly sized spacers. To see what this means, let\u2019s look at a cross section of the complete weapon assembly. The bolt\u2019s head and the nut squeeze the assembly, and the small purple arrows show the force propagating toward the central area between the two ACBs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing this from the left end to the center:\n\nThe bolt head (red) pushes inward on the chassis plate (red outline).\n\nThe chassis plate pushes on a spacer (yellow).\n\nThe spacer pushes on the inner race of the LEFT ACB (orange).\n\nThe ACB pushes on two things:\n\nThe preload spacer (red)\n\nThe force travels directly through the inner race.\n\nThe weapon blade/pulley assembly (cyan/green)\n\nThe force travels from the ACB\u2019s inner race through the balls and outer race before actually pushing on the weapon blade.\n\nAnalyzing this from the right end to the center:\n\nThe nut (blue) pushes on the chassis plate (red outline).\n\nThe chassis plate pushes on a spacer (yellow).\n\nThe spacer pushes on the inner race of the RIGHT ACB (orange).\n\nThe ACB pushes on two things:\n\nThe preload spacer (red)\n\nThe force travels directly through the inner race.\n\nThe weapon blade/pulley assembly (cyan/green)\n\nThe force travels from the ACB\u2019s inner race through the balls and outer race before actually pushing on the weapon pulley.\n\n\n\nFrom these analyses, we can see there are two things being compressed in the center:\n\nThe central spacer, between the inner races (length A)\n\nThe weapon blade/pulley, between the outer races (length B)\n\nIf A is shorter than B, then when the nut is tightened, the force will travel through the balls and outer race of the bearing (this is a preload). If A is longer than B, then when the nut is tightened, the force will only go through the preload spacer (the balls will be loose; there is no preload).\n\n\n\nThis leaves us with two ways to adjust the preload on a weapon assembly:\n\nBy tightening or loosening the nut: this changes the total compressive load through the system, and it\u2019s very easy to adjust without disassembling anything. However, loosening the nut too much can weaken the system overall, and no human can tighten it beyond a certain point.\n\nBy changing the length of the preload spacer: since the metal parts compress slightly, it\u2019s possible to distribute the load between the preload spacer and the balls of the ACBs. By tweaking the length, we can put 80% of the load through the preload spacer and 20% of the load through the balls. This lets us tighten the nut more, keeping the assembly strong without applying too much preload to the ACBs.\n\nHow do you change the length of the preload spacer without re-manufacturing it? By adding or removing shims. Shims are like extremely thin washers with precise thicknesses, and you can add them between the preload spacer and the inner race of an ACB. This is often tricky and fiddly to do, because the spacer is (and must be) in the center of the weapon assembly.\n\nSuper fun exercise that will haunt you until you figure it out\n\nNow that you understand the principles of preloading, try analyzing the forces in Beater B. Barker\u2019s weapon/flywheel assembly. This one has two pairs of ACBs, so it\u2019s twice as fun!\n\n\n\nTake a screenshot of the cross section below and draw out the little force arrows. Can you find the preload spacer here? Where would you add shims?",
    "How-To_ Choose ESCs.txt": "How to choose ESCs\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nYou will need 1 ESC per motor. In order to choose your ESC, you need to know which motors you are using. \n\n\n\nChoosing an ESC\n\nYour motor should have a maximum continuous current rating. Find it. (For example, this motor has a max continuous current of 35A.)\n\nFind an ESC (preferably not from eBay) that has an amperage rating that is at least this value. \n\nFor the example above, you would want a 35A ESC or greater. \\\n\nMake sure that the S rating is the same as your battery. \n\nMake sure that it\u2019s compatible with your motor type (brushed or brushless). \n\nThat\u2019s literally it. \n\n\n\nBidirectionality\n\nIf this ESC is for your drivetrain, you must make sure that your ESC is bidirectional. If it is not explicitly stated as bidirectional, it is not recommended that you order it. \n\nIf it\u2019s not bidirectional, you will not be able to drive backwards. \n\nFor your weapon, this might be something to keep in mind, but may not be a requirement. \n\nFor example, most spinning weapons only need to go in 1 direction. Lifters, however, may need to move in both directions in a controlled manner.",
    "How-To_ Take Care of Your LiPo Battery.txt": "How to take care of your LiPo battery\n\nSafety guidelines\n\nDo not charge a LiPo cell above 4.2 V. This can cause the battery to set on fire. \n\nLiPo cells are permanently and irreparably damaged if discharged below about 2.8 V per cell.\n\nBecause LiPo batteries can be unstable, it is important to always store them in LiPo bags and watch the battery when charging them. Give it a poke every once and a while to make sure it\u2019s not heating up too much. \n\nAlways discard a LiPo battery that exhibits early signs of damage, such as \u201cpuffy\u201d swelling of the wrapping. \n\nNever use any charger except for a charger specifically designed for LiPo batteries. \n\nIt is best to charge your battery out of the robot and in a charging bag. \n\nCharging your battery inside the robot is fine for a few charge cycles (for example, in between matches at competition) but over time it may allow the charge state of individual battery cells to drift from optimum. \n\nIf your battery catches on fire, back away and leave it in the LiPo bag if it is already in a bag. Grab the fire extinguisher by CMR\u2019s table or the sand and use it to extinguish the fire. Sand will also work if a fire extinguisher is not available. Do not use water on a LiPo fire!!!\n\nHow to charge your LiPo battery\n\nAlways make sure that the black wire goes to the black wire, and the red wire goes to the red wire. \n\nPlug the main connector of your battery into the battery charger (this connector is most likely a yellow XT60). \n\nPlug in the balance port to the charger. This is the smaller white connector.\n\nThere are different connectors depending on how many cells your battery has. Make sure you plug in the correct one (for example, a 6S battery should plug into the 6S port). \n\nThe balance port makes sure that all of the cells in your battery charge equally, which will prolong the life of your battery. \n\nThe amperage setting on your charger should be the following: \n\nIf your battery is 4200 mAh, you should charge at 4.2 A. If your battery is 2400 mAh, you should charge at 2.4 A, etc. \n\nThe voltage setting on your charger should be the following:\n\nYour battery might have the voltage written directly on it. If there is no voltage, you can calculate the voltage using the following: Voltage = 3.8 * number of cells\n\nFor example, for a 2S battery, your voltage setting should be 7.6V (or 3.8*2)\n\nHold down the charge button.\n\nConfirm your settings. \n\nYour battery should now be charging!\n\n\n\nWhat Constitutes a Damaged Battery?\n\nAny battery that has excessive swelling, or loses it\u2019s distinct rectangular shape.\n\nAt competition, if something indents a battery or damages it in any way beyond the most superficial impacts, you should refrain from using or charging the battery at all costs! If charged or used further, this can cause a fire. AT NRHL, A FIRE IN THE PITS WILL DISQUALIFY THE BOT IMMEDIATELY! DON'T TAKE THE RISK! A fire in the cage will lead to the entire robot getting thrown in the trash, and they will not give you access to it for a long time to make sure it will not explode or set on fire again. DON\u2019T TAKE THE RISK!!!\n\nHow to Dispose of a Damaged LiPO/LiHV Battery\n\nIn a plastic container, dissolve \u00bd cup of salt in 1 gallon of cold water. \n\nDrop the battery into the salt water and leave it there for at least 2 weeks. \n\nRemove the battery, wrap it in paper, and throw it in the trash.\n\nRestoring Over-Discharged LiPos:\n\nStep 1: Initial Restoration Phase (LiPo < 3.3V/cell)\n\n\tWarning: While LiPos are <3.3V/cell, do NOT leave unattended. Constantly monitor through touching batteries to ensure they do not get hot and making sure the battery is not puffing. Always charge batteries in a LiPo bag. NiMh chargers do not detect end-of-charge, so if left unattended LiPo battery will catch fire. \n\n\n\nUse NiMh BATT charger setting (without the balance board connected) with 0.1A until the battery reaches 3.3V * #cells in charge. \n\nFor 6S battery- 19.8V\n\nFor 4S battery- 13.2V\n\n\n\nFig 1: Step 1, Initial Restoration Phase.\n\n\n\nFig 2: Photo of charger settings, Step 1.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Post-Restoration Phase (LiPo > 3.3V/cell)\n\nWarning: Charge within LiPo battery bag. Always watch the battery while charging. Do not charge to 100% charge, in order to avoid battery damage. \n\nCharge anywhere between 0.5C and 1C on LIPO BATT mode. The lower the capacitance, the slower the batter will charge, but the safer it will be. Do not exceed 1C.\n\nExample: 1300 mAh 4S (14.8V) battery\n\n1C- Charge at 1.3A\n\n0.5C- Charge at 0.65A\n\nContinue watching the batter as it charges, unplugging as it approaches max \n\n\n\n\n\nLiHV Batteries:\n\nLiHV batteries are essentially LiPO batteries, but with a slightly higher voltage, hence the HV meaning High Voltage. For most cases, they can be treated the same as LiPO batteries, however, their maximum voltage is 4.35 Volts per cell, as opposed to 4.2.\n\nYou can adjust this by pressing the cycle button when LiPO is flashing on the charger screen, and selecting LiHV instead.\n\nLiHV batteries can still be charged at 4.2 Volts per cell, they will just hold less power than they could.\n\nNOTE: SMC Racing will make custom batteries if you email orders@smc-racing.com\n\nThis includes LiHV and LiPO batteries, how custom is custom is yet to be determined (we should email and talk)",

    "How-To_ Machine (Guidelines & Tips).txt": "How to machine\n\nThe basics\n\n\tThis link leads to videos that explains how to use the basic functions of the manual mill and manual lathe, along with other machinery like the belt sander and the horizontal bandsaw. Instead of me explaining how to machine, watch these videos; if you\u2019re looking for information about a specific operation (i.e. tapping), open the video and refer to the timestamps in the first few seconds of the video. If a commonly used operation is not explained in these videos, it will be explained in this section. \n\nThe Cornell Official Emerson Machining Manual also has a lot of information that may be useful. \n\nHow to zero the z-axis on the manual mill\n\nNOTE that every single time you change your tool, you have to re-zero your z-axis! So adjust your order of operations accordingly\u2026\n\nFind the shim paper hiding around the shop somewhere\u2014it looks like the picture below. (It looks like tissue paper, but it\u2019s shiny.) Alternatively, if you can\u2019t find shim paper, you can use your part drawing. \n\n\t\n\nUsing the rough z-axis adjuster that is at eye-level, position your part so it is sort-of close to your tool. The precise z-axis is a pain to move, so you\u2019ll be happier the less you\u2019ll have to move it. \n\nLOCK THE ROUGH Z-AXIS by turning the little knob that\u2019s near the big handle (see the figure below). You do not want this to move from here on out, otherwise you\u2019ll lose your zero!\n\n\n\nPut your shim paper/part drawing between your part and the tool. Slowly move the precise z-axis (henceforth just known as the z-axis) upward while wiggling your paper simultaneously. The moment the paper gets snagged by the tool and stops moving, don\u2019t move the z-axis anymore!\n\nZero the z-axis by loosening the grippy part of the handle and rotating the marker part of the handle until the number \u20180\u2019 lines up with the small line. Then, re-tighten the grippy part. (By grippy part, I mean the round part that feels like it has a lot of grip.)\n\n\t\t\n\nIf you need your depth to be extra precise, offset your z-axis by the thickness of your paper. You can measure this thickness using calipers. (The shim paper is 0.001\u201d thick.)\n\nYou have now zeroed your z-axis! Congrats! Remember that each line on your z-axis handle is 0.001\u201d and there are 100 marks per rotation\u2014therefore, 1 full rotation of the z-axis handle is 0.1\u201d.\n\nIf your depth is 0.5\u201d, rotate the handle 5 times.\n\nEtc etc etc\u2026\n\n\n\nHow to drill off-center holes in a circle\n\n\tFor example:\n\n\n\n\tSince the lathe only drills center holes, you\u2019ll need to use the mill. Follow the steps below:\n\nFind a v-block that fits around your part such that the circle is clamped between the v-block and the vise, as shown in the picture below. The part should be resting on parallels, as always. Make sure your part is sticking above the v-block and the vise so you have material you can zero off of. \n\n\t\tINSERT A PICTURE HERE\n\nSet up the wiggler tool for zeroing. \n\nFor the following step, do not adjust the y-axis!\n\nTouch the wiggler to one side of the circle as you would normally. Zero this side. \n\nMove the wiggler to the other side without touching the y-axis and touch the wiggler to the other side. DO NOT ZERO. Instead, hit the center-line button (which looks like the picture below) and then hit \u2018X.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe x-axis is now zeroed on the center of your part. Repeat step 3 for the y-axis by using the wiggler tool on the top and bottom of the part without moving the x-axis!\n\nThe mill is now zeroed in the center of your part. From here, you can drill all your holes. Hopefully the hole placements in your part drawing are defined using ordinate dimensions from the center! \ud83d\ude00\n\n\n\nHow to machine plastic\n\n\tDON\u2019T \n\nCommon issues\n\nMy tap broke!\n\nOopsie! That sucks. Unfortunately, this probably means that your part is no longer usable (though this may vary on a case-by-case basis). Since the tap is made of a much harder metal than your drill bits, there\u2019s no way to drill through it. You may now take this part home and put it on your wall of failures. \n\nThere are 4 common culprits that lead to tap breaking:\n\nYou used too much pressure: When you tap a hole, you should not be pushing downward at all. If you have to use force to get your tap to cut threads, then something is wrong. The only force you should apply is horizontal to twist the tap in a circle. \n\nYou used too much torque: Try not to use a tap handle that is way too big for the hole you\u2019re tapping. There\u2019s no real metric for this, just try to find a tap handle that feels right. If you use one that\u2019s way too big, there\u2019s a bigger chance that small errors can cause your tap to break (like not being completely aligned or hitting the bottom of the hole). \n\nYou continued tapping even when you reached the bottom of the hole: This aligns with #1. Do not use force to go down! When you reach the bottom of the hole or feel any resistance, stop. If you use a \u201cbottoming tap\u201d (which looks like the first picture) as opposed to a \u201ctaper tap\u201d (which looks like the second picture) then when you hit the bottom of the hole, your tap will stop instantly.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\nYour tap wasn\u2019t straight: This usually happens if you\u2019re tapping by hand (which is a bit risky, and I don\u2019t recommend it). If you absolutely must tap by hand, always have someone else watching you from multiple angles to make sure you\u2019re tapping straight. \n\n\n\nMy parallels keep moving and I can\u2019t get them to stay still!\n\n\t\tThis could be for a bunch of reasons. I\u2019ll list a few below:\n\nYour part isn\u2019t square! If it\u2019s not sitting flat against the parallels, it\u2019ll look like the picture below. If possible, try to choose an orientation that consists of the 3 most square sides of your stock so it fits nicely, like the second picture. If there are no 3 sides that are square enough, you\u2019ll have to face one side of your stock, rotate, face another side, rotate again, face a 3rd side, and repeat this process until your part is square enough to secure those parallels. \n\n\t\n\n\n\nYou didn\u2019t mess with it enough! Sometimes it just takes some wiggling. Something I like to do (which usually works) is press my hand down on the part while I tighten the vise, which helps to secure it a bit better before I use the mallet and then tighten again. \n\nYou didn\u2019t whack it with the hammer hard enough! Give it a really good smack. Don\u2019t be shy, you know you want to. Make sure to smack it when it\u2019s secure in the vise\u2014if you hit it and it\u2019s not secure, it\u2019ll just go flying (or make a really loud noise). \n\n\n\nI turned on the machine and it made a really loud and scary noise!\n\n\tThis is probably because your machine\u2014whether you\u2019re using a lathe or a mill\u2014wasn\u2019t\n\n in gear. It\u2019s similar to a bike\u2014if you change gears but the chain slips or gets stuck, no more bike riding for you. \n\n\tOn the mill, there is a small lever that you move if you want to shift from high range to low range. If you don't move the lever all the way to one side, your mill will make a terrible noise. Make sure the lever is all the way to one side\u2014if it\u2019s stuck, spin the collet holder in circles until it moves. Spinning the collet holder will shift the gears inside the mill until they align. If you\u2019re spinning and the gear still isn\u2019t locking it into place, try putting it back into the other gear, running it for a few seconds, turning it off, and then trying again. \n\n\n\nOn the lathe, it\u2019s a similar issue\u2014you\u2019re probably stuck in-between RPM ranges. Make sure the lever is completely on a single RPM range\u2014if it\u2019s stuck, put the lathe in neutral (by shifting the \u201con\u201d lever to its middle position) and spin the lathe chuck until the lever clicks into place. \n\nFeeds, Speeds, and Step Sizes\n\n\tThis video explains how to calculate RPM based on your tool, part size, and material. The details of this video are summarized below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSFM values can be found in the table below. \n\nFor a mill, the \u201cDiameter\u201d is the size of the cutter (drill bit). On the lathe, \u201cDiameter\u201d refers to the size of the stock if you\u2019re cutting the outside; if you\u2019re boring or drilling a hole, \u201cDiameter\u201d will be the size of the hole. \n\n\tThe constant 3.82 is 12/\u03c0; it converts surface feet into surface inches. For manual machines, you can replace the 3.82 with the number 4 to make calculations easier. Manual machines will most likely not have the exact RPM value you need, but this formula will give you a good range. Based on what the machine provides, always choose a number under your calculated RPM. \n\n\n\n\tThe SFM table below is based on high-speed steel (HSS) tools. For carbide tools, you can double these numbers. If you\u2019re not sure what type of tool you have, assume it is an HSS tool. \n\n\n\nSFM Values for Various Materials\n\n\n\nMild steel (i.e. any steel that has not been hardened)\n\n90\n\nTool steel\n\n50\n\nMystery steel (i.e. steel stock that you found, but you\u2019re unsure of the alloy or treatment)\n\n50\n\nHardened steel\n\n50\n\nAluminum\n\n150\n\nBrass\n\n150\n\nBronze\n\n100\n\nStainless steel\n\n40\n\n\n\nThe following quick guide is for use with the manual machines in Emerson.

    "How-To_ Design an Asymmetric Spinning Weapon.txt": "How to design an asymmetric spinning weapon\n\n\n\nAn asymmetric weapon can achieve twice the bite depth as a symmetric weapon at the same RPM. This is helpful for being extra destructive in the box. But it can be tricky to design one, because you have to make sure it spins about its center of mass (CM). In a symmetric weapon, you can just put the bearing hole in the visual center of the part, but you can\u2019t do that when you go asymmetric. This guide explains how to design an asymmetric weapon, including a nice way to get Fusion to automatically position the hole.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nIf you have a basic understanding of parameters and are good at making fully constrained sketches in Fusion, this should be relatively straightforward.\n\nOverview\n\nThis guide shows you how to do the following:\n\nSet up a new Fusion file with a point that is positioned based on specifically defined user parameters. This will be the point you reference in any features that need to follow the CM.\n\nInstall a script that updates the CM parameters to match the coordinates of the actual center of mass.\n\nSketch a rough version of the weapon profile, keeping it simple and anchored to the origin, and include a bearing hole anchored to the CM point. Extrude the profile to create a body with a center of mass.\n\nRun the script and verify/debug the model as you adjust your design.\n\nStep 1: Set up the Fusion file\n\nIn order for later steps to work properly, you need to create a new Fusion design file with nothing else in it. First, create five user parameters with these exact names and units:\n\nCM_x (units: cm)\n\nCM_y (units: cm)\n\nCM_z (units: cm)\n\nCM_inaccuracy (units: cm)\n\nCM_iterations (no units)\n\nThe script won\u2019t work properly unless all five parameters exist and are exactly as shown above. You\u2019ll have to provide a value for each one as you create it, but these initial values don\u2019t matter to the script, so do something like this to keep it from overlapping with the origin point:\n\nCM_x = 1\n\nCM_y = 2\n\nCM_z = 3\n\nCM_inaccuracy = 0\n\nCM_iterations = 0\n\nNow that you have the parameters, create a point that follows them (the CM point). Make three Offset Planes defined using the parameters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen define the point as an intersection of those planes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you can hide the planes and rename your point, like this:\n\n\n\nNow you can project this point into any sketches you make.\n\nStep 2: Install the script to make the CM point actually follow the CM\n\nFusion lets you write custom scripts in Python or C++, which can interact with Fusion in many ways. The script you\u2019ll use looks up the center of mass of the file and writes its XYZ coordinates to CM_x, CM_y, and CM_z (but only if these parameters already exist\u2014you\u2019ll get an error if they don\u2019t). The script is available in a zip file: CenterOfMassParameters.zip.\n\n\n\nInstall the script by downloading the zip file and moving it to...\n\non Windows: %AppData%\\Autodesk\\Autodesk Fusion 360\\API\\Scripts\n\non Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion/API/Scripts\n\nThen extract it there. It should end up in its own folder called CenterOfMassParameters.\n\nStep 3: Sketch and extrude the weapon blade\n\nOnce you know what general shape you want out of the weapon, you can sketch it on one of the origin planes. To keep the profile stable when the script updates the center of mass, you should constrain at least one major feature at the origin. Otherwise, feel free to constrain features to the CM point and each other\u2014just keep things simple so you can fix it if something goes wrong during a center-of-mass update.\n\n\n\nHaving sketched the profile, extrude it to create a body that has a center of mass. The script won\u2019t work unless there\u2019s a body in the file.\n\n\n\nNote: you can add other parts to the file if, for example, you want the weapon shape to account for the weight of an off-center screw. Just make sure every part (including the weapon blade itself) is the right material/density/weight.\n\nStep 4: Run the script and verify the results\n\nOnce you have the script installed, you can access it through the menu shown in the picture below, or by pressing Shift+S and running CenterOfMassParameters. Fusion should find the script automatically when you open the Scripts and Add-Ins dialogue, but if CenterOfMassParameters doesn\u2019t show up, try restarting Fusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince you\u2019ve set up the document well in step 1, you should be able to just run the script by clicking on it and clicking Run. This will update CM_x, CM_y, and CM_z to match the actual center of mass of the part.\n\n\n\nThis script iterates for you, and here\u2019s why: if you\u2019ve dimensioned any features based on the center-of-mass point you made, those features will move each time the script updates the center of mass. This, in turn, will change the object\u2019s center of mass. To deal with this, the script runs iterations of this process until either:\n\nThe CM moves less than 0.01 cm from the last iteration, or\n\nIt runs 50 iterations. If this happens, you need to change (most likely simplify) your design to make the iterative process converge.\n\nYou can tweak the tolerance and max iteration count by editing the code and saving.\n\nImportant: check that the script is working properly!\n\nThere\u2019s always a chance something has changed about Fusion\u2019s API, or that something about your file is tripping up the script and giving incorrect results. You can check for this by showing the center of mass point in a way that doesn\u2019t rely on the script.\n\n\n\nYou can find an option to display the center of mass in the Utilities tab, Inspect menu, as shown below. Unexpectedly, this non-selectable display object will only update when you orbit your view around the part. Make sure to orbit frequently when checking for discrepancies.",

    "How-To_ Set Up_Program Your Transmitter.txt": "How to program your transmitter\n\nA transmitter is the remote controller that you hold to control the robot. It\u2019s commonly confused with the receiver, a small box that sits inside the robot taking instructions from the transmitter and sending them to the ESCs. Since it\u2019s an important part of transmitter setup, this guide covers how to set up a receiver too. \n\nWhat kind of transmitter are you using?\n\nThis is an important question, because the process is completely different for different transmitters. On CRC as of Spring 2024, we have two kinds of transmitters:\n\nFRSky Taranis X-Lite S\n\nRed, looks kind of like a gaming controller\n\nMore expensive\n\nHas more programmable switches, buttons, and knobs\n\nFancy: supports many model configs, telemetry, and complicated sensitivity curves\n\nRuns on rechargeable batteries, and can be charged via Micro-USB\n\nUsed for Rosie and Beater B. Barker so far\n\nFlySky FS-i6\n\nBlack, looks like an RC plane controller\n\nCheaper\n\nSimpler, but perhaps has a more confusing interface and settings navigation system\n\nRuns on AA batteries (not rechargeable)\n\nUsed for all other bots so far\n\nWhat receiver are you using?\n\nThis is an equally important question, because the receiver has to use the same protocol as the transmitter. This means a receiver that works with the FlySky FS-i6 won\u2019t work with the FRSky Taranis X-Lite. Double check what protocols are supported by the transmitter you\u2019re using, and select a receiver that uses one of those protocols.\n\nHow to get a receiver to work\n\nMake sure it has power. This is easiest to provide using the BEC output from an ESC.\n\nThe BEC output is almost always the middle wire of the 3-pin connector on little wires that comes out of the ESC. If there\u2019s no middle wire, that ESC doesn\u2019t have a BEC.\n\nMake sure you\u2019re connecting the 3-wire connectors in the right orientation. The markings are hard to see, and often the signal and negative markings look quite similar. If an ESC isn\u2019t initializing the way you\u2019re expecting, try flipping the 3-wire connector.\n\nSetup: FrSky Taranis X-Lite\n\nGet the transmitter (it looks like this)\n\n[case, closed]   [transmitter in case, open]\n\n\n\nMake sure it\u2019s charged: plug the transmitter into a USB phone charger with a micro-USB cable.\n\nYou can\u2019t use the transmitter while doing this. If you need to use the transmitter while also charging the batteries, you can swap to a charged pair of batteries and charge the old ones on the dedicated charger we have. See Appendix A1: Charging the batteries externally  how to swap the batteries and charge them externally: \n\nMake sure the antenna is on: screw the antenna onto the top\n\n \n\nPress and hold the power button (button 8) to turn it on\n\nHow navigation works\n\nJoystick 1 is the navigation control joystick\u2013 to move between menus, long-hold this joystick to either side to switch between menus.\n\nButton 2 is the back button- press this button to exit out of any option that is selected\n\nButton 3 is a select button. Clicking this button allows you to select and change setting. \n\nJoysticks 4 and 5 are the throttle joysticks. These are used to control the robot, but do not have any use in adjusting the settings. Joystick 4 is for controlling the starboard side of the robot, and Joystick 5 is for controlling the port side of the robot. \n\nButton 6, The + pad, is mostly just for adjusting trims and not used for adjusting the ++settings.\n\nSwitches 7 and 8 are switches that can be configured depending on what you need to toggle. For Beater B Barker, these switches shut off/turn on the weapon and flywheel.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram: FrSky Taranis X-Lite\n\n\n\nGo to the MIXES screen\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the channel with the ESC you want to program\n\nAs an example, I will use CH3\n\n\n\nSelect Edit\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Source\n\nWhile selected, move the control you want the ESC to be bound to\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reverse the direction of a motor, set Weight to -100\n\n\n\n\n\nTo set a switch (typically used for weapon ESCs), scroll down and repeat step 4 with Switch\n\n\n\n\n\nTo bind multiple controls to one channel, select the channel\n\nSelect Insert After\n\nRepeat step 4\n\n\n\n\n\nExample video:\n\ndrive.google.com/file/d/1-B6lAepcTC9rxdcHlyd-PQhjrbcpKTpo/view?usp=drive_link \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix A - Taranis X-Lite\n\nAppendix A1: Charging the batteries externally\n\nThe battery covers are circled below\u2013 they unscrew in the direction indicated, and each \u2018leg\u2019 holds one 18500 battery.

    "How-To_ Make a Part Drawing.txt": "How to make a part drawing from a CAD model\n\nHow to make a part drawing:\n\nOpen Fusion. \n\nIn the top left of the screen, there is a box that says \u201cDesign.\u201d Click the dropdown menu and select \u201cDrawing,\u201d then \u201cFrom Design.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your part is a component of a greater assembly: In the box that appears, under \u201cContents,\u201d change \u201cFull Assembly\u201d to \u201cSelect.\u201d From there, you can select the part that you want to make a drawing of. (It\u2019s easiest to do this from the dropdown menu to the left as opposed to clicking directly on the CAD. That way you know you\u2019re selecting the correct part). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder \u201cTemplate,\u201d select \u201cCRC Part Drawing Template\u201d to make sure your part drawing is the correct formatting. \n\nIf \u201cPart Drawing Template\u201d does not appear, go to: Browse \u2192 Templates and Backups \u2192 Templates \u2192 CRC Part Drawing Template\n\nClick OK. \n\nDouble check a few settings:\n\nOn the left, hover over \u201cDocument Settings\u201d and click the little gear on the right. \n\nMake sure your units are in inches. \n\nChange \u201cLinear Precision\u201d to 0.1234 and \u201cAngular Precision\u201d to 0.123. \n\nFrom there, start making your drawing! \n\n\n\n\nFor MechE purposes:\n\nThis section will outline some tips for how to make efficient and effective part drawing, so that your machinist can go to the machine shop and NOT have to do any math!\n\n\n\nProjected views\n\nAlways use projected views! (Unless you\u2019re putting an isometric view in the corner for reference.) That way the machinist does not have to guess which side of the part the drawing is referring to. Projected views can be found under Create \u2192 Projected View (or the shortcut P). \n\nSymmetry\n\nIf your part has symmetry, use centerlines so you don\u2019t have to do more work than you have to. Centerlines can be found under Geometry \u2192 Centerline. Use this to identify the axis across which the part is symmetric. Also make a text note in the empty box that says \u201cSymmetric about centerline(s)\u201d so it\u2019s extra clear to the machinist. \n\nOrdinate Dimensioning\n\nUnder the \u201cDimensions\u201d tab on the top bar there is an option labeled \u201cOrdinate Dimension.\u201d This is especially useful for parts with lots of dimensions since it vastly clears up the space by creating the dimensions from a common zero point. Use this feature as often as you can to make the drawing as clean as possible. There are pictures below for comparison. \n\nOrdinate dimensions are also much easier for the machinist to use, since it mimics the way the machine actually works. \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBad\t\t\t\t\t\tGood\n\n\n\n\n\nHole Tool\n\nAll of the holes in the CAD should be made using the Hole Tool, which means that in the drawing, Fusion can automatically dimension the hole with the correct features. Under the \u201cText\u201d tab on the top bar there is a \u201cHole and Thread Note\u201d option. Click on this, then click on the hole you want to dimension. This note should include the number of holes that the note pertains to, so you don\u2019t have to repeat this for every single hole. \n\nSee the \u201cSide tangent about holes and threads\u201d section for more information about what all of the stuff on your hole note means. \n\nOther things to include\n\nIn the box in the bottom right corner, be sure to include other features like tolerances and units. The drawing below has typical values for these features, and is also a good example of ordinate dimensioning (good job Ricky\ud83d\udc4d). \n\nDon\u2019t forget the thickness!! That is usually the most missed dimension since you need a separate projected view from it. (The drawing below doesn\u2019t have it because the thickness is included under \u201cMaterials,\u201d but it\u2019s good practice to include it in the drawing anyway so the machinist doesn\u2019t have to look for it.)\n\nExample drawing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide tangent about holes and threads\n\nBelow is a table of common symbols you\u2019ll see related to your Hole and Thread Note. \n\n\n\nSymbol\n\nWhat it means\n\nWhat you should do about it (if anything)\n\n[A number]X\n\ni.e. 4X\n\nThere are 4 holes on this part that have the same features as this hole.\n\nNothing\n\n\n\nDiameter: A number following this symbol will indicate the diameter of the hole before the tapping operation.\n\nIf this hole is going to be tapped, make sure that the number indicated after the diameter is an actual drill size. Drill sizes are either fraction or numbered; look up which drill bit most closely matches your hole size, and then put that size in parenthesis next to the number so your machinist doesn\u2019t have to look anything up while they\u2019re machining!\n\n\n\nFor example: \n\n\n\n\n\nCounterbore: A number following this symbol will indicate the depth of the counterbore.\n\nNothing\n\n\n\nCountersink: This will be accompanied by a diameter and an angle that the countersink should be. \n\nNothing\n\n\n\nDepth: The number following this symbol indicates how deep the hole should be. \n\nIf you know that the hole is a through hole and does not require a certain depth, then remove this symbol and its number and replace it with the word THRU. It\u2019s more simple and compact, and makes more sense to the machinist. \n\n[A number] - [Another number]\n\ni.e. 10-24, \u00bc-20, etc.\n\nThis indicates the type of thread: The first number tells you what the diameter is, and the second number tells you the number of threads per inch. \n\n\n\nNote that for diameters below \u00bc\u201d, the standard turns to number instead of fractions. \n\ni.e. A #10 screw is smaller than a \u00bc\u201d screw, and a #8 screw is smaller than #10. \n\nNothing\n\nUNC\n\nUnified Coarse Threads: Indicates that the thread type is coarse. (This is what we usually use.)\n\nNothing\n\nUNF\n\nUnified Fine Threads: Indicates that the thread type is fine.\n\nNothing\n\n2A or 2B or anything of the sort\n\nRepresents the class of thread. \n\n\n\n1A, 2A, and 3A apply to external threads. \n\n\n\n1B, 2B, and 3B apply to internal threads. \n\nThe 1, 2, or 3 class isn\u2019t super necessary for our purposes, so feel free to delete (but it doesn\u2019t matter too much).\n\nLH\n\nIndicates the direction of the thread (right-handed or left-handed). \n\nYou should never see LH! Delete an LH if you see it!\n\n\n\nThis happens if people mirror their hole features in the CAD.\n\n\n\nFor Marketing purposes:\n\nThis section will outline how to get good line drawings of robots in any view (side view, isometric, etc.) using Fusion. You can use this for merch, advertising, or whatever you\u2019d like!\n\n\n\nFor example: \n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Fusion\n\nOpen the main file for the bot (the drawing will look exactly like the model you choose)\n\n\n\nClick design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick drawing, then from design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Just click OK\n\n\n\n\n\nNOW DO NOT CLICK ANYWHERE! There should be a little pixelated robot following your cursor as you move it on the drawing space, it looks hella jank but just trust the process\n\nClicking isn\u2019t the end of the world, if you do click scroll down to step 9\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can change settings as you need. Decrease the scale ratio to make the drawing bigger (try 1:2), or change the perspective of the drawing in orientation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019re done, click to place the robot down then click OK\n\nThe drawing is now done! But there are some other things on it\n\nIf you accidentally clicked in step 6: right click on the outline and click move to move the drawing\n\nto resize, right click and click edit view\n\n\n\n9a. Once you hit move just click anywhere on the robot then move your mouse and it will move. When you\u2019re done, hit ok\n\n\n\nTo remove the words, just select it, right click, and hit delete (you can also hit the delete button on the keyboard). Do the same with the outer box.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have to export it! Click the drop down from export and click export PDF, then save it to your computer (not to fusion)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you need a png to remove the background to the outline, so I just take a screenshot of the pdf zoomed in (use F11 for better quality image? Doesn\u2019t rly matter)\n\n\n\n\n\nUse https://remove-white-background.imageonline.co/ or a related background removing website to remove all the white so it\u2019s just the outline\n\nI like that website because you can scale how much white you remove from the photo\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re done! \n\nIf you want, you can edit the photo in Procreate, Photoshop, etc., just alpha lock the transparent image and draw over it with black because there is a tiny outline in white\u2026 \n\nSame goes for if you need a white outline",

    "How-To_ Safely Test Your Robot.txt": "How to safely test your robot in the test box\n\n\n\nSafety is the most important thing to keep in mind during testing. Even when you are testing a system that\u2019s already been tested before, problems such as sparking or fires can happen at any time, so always follow safety protocols!\n\n\n\nBEFORE TESTING:\n\nMake sure you are aware of the nearest fire extinguisher. For LiPo batteries, you should use a Carbon-Dioxide extinguisher or an ABC Dry Chemical Extinguisher \n\nUsing water on these components will light them on fire more. Please don\u2019t do that.\n\nPrepare the test box. Robots should always be tested in the textbox. Even if the weapon will not be spinning, the testbox can help smother and separate you from the robot in the event of it lighting on fire. \n\nRemoving the weapon lock should be the last thing you do before immediately shutting the test box. The safest order of operations is:\n\nFirst, turn on the transmitter\n\nSecond, turn on the power switch\n\n(Doing this in the opposite order may result in interfering with the fail-safe on the transmitter.) \n\nFinally, remove the weapon lock and IMMEDIATELY close the test box.\n\nNot following this order can lead to ESCs lighting on fire, injuries from a weapon erroneously spinning, and destruction of electronics.\n\n\n\n\n\nDURING TESTING: \n\nDo not open the text box under any circumstances. Opening the textbox can lead to shrapnel or fumes injuring someone. \n\nIf a hole opens up in the textbox, cease testing the robot immediately. Testing must be paused until the hole can be fixed. It is necessary to have a fully enclosed testbox. \n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT TO TEST FOR:\n\nAccording to the Riobotz Combot Tutorial, the most common causes for a robot to lose a match are:\n\nBattery connectors or other wires getting loose \n\nSolution: Use good quality connectors, always use ring terminals over fork terminals, and use liquid electrical tape or hot glue\n\nMotors, batteries, or other components getting loose\n\nSolution: Avoid using nylon ties or clamps, tighten critical screws before each match, use threadlockers or spring locks\n\nChains coming off from sprockets\n\nSolution: Make sure sprockets are well aligned, avoid exposed sprockets, or replace chains with timing belts that withstand larger misalignments.\n\nHeavy impacts due to fall damage:\n\nSolution: Test robot by dropping it from 6ft up, which is around the highest one of our robots would be flung into the air.\n\nImproperly charged or low capacity batteries:\n\nSolution: Always use electronic chargers, check battery voltage before each match, and calculate AND test robot\u2019s consumption under real conditions. \n\nSmoking ESCs:\n\nSolution: Always match the maximum acceptable current in the controller with the motor specs, if a wheel or a spinning weapon gets stuck, turn it off to avoid stalling the motor. \n\nRupture of rivets, screws, nuts:\n\nSolution: never use rivets, always use hardened steel screws and nuts (class 8.8 or 10.9 for hex screws, class 12.9 for Allen, and appropriate diameters for what they will be fastening). \n\nLow-clearance robots getting stuck in the arena:\n\nSolution: Make sure you have a ground clearance of at least \u00bc\u201d (preferably \u215c\u201d), use flathead screws on the bottom of the robot to ensure they do not get stuck, and don\u2019t forget the wear and tear of wheels.",
    "How-To_ Solder (Guidelines & Tips).txt": "How to solder\n\nGeneral guidelines\n\nDO NOT FORGET HEAT SHRINK!!\n\nThe soldering iron should be between 550 and 600 degrees Fahrenheit (check your units!). Depending on how old/worn out the soldering tip is, you might need to go a bit higher, but you shouldn\u2019t reach 700 degrees.\n\nUse the solder sucker! It\u2019ll keep the fumes out of your face so you don\u2019t breathe them in. \n\nThe key to soldering is holding your iron in one place and waiting. As solder melts, the surface tension will pull the solder towards itself and create a puddle that will be smooth when it melts. That\u2019s how you get the nice shiny finish!\n\n\n\nWire to wire\n\nCombine the wires: You know how in Avatar (the movie with the blue people) they do the hair thing that connects with other hair? That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do\u2014just like in the first picture, but make sure to press the wires down closer together. (If you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about you may refer to this video for reference.) Alternatively, you can twist your wires together like they\u2019re giving each other a hug, as seen in the second picture. \n\n\t\t\n\nSolder: Glob some solder on there. The more you can get in between the wire threads, the better. Try to make it as smooth as possible, if you can. \n\nFinish: If you don\u2019t have any wires hanging out by themselves and if the wires don\u2019t come apart when you pull them, then you\u2019re probably good. \n\n\n\nWire to XT60/MT60/MR30/MR60\n\nPut heat shrink on your wire! \n\nTin the wire: A good tinned wire should look like the one below (though I would strip the wire maybe half that amount). The biggest plus about tinning is it\u2019ll keep the wire threads from fraying as you put the wire into the connector. A second plus about tinning is that when you heat the solder, you know the solder will already be at the end of the wire that you can\u2019t reach once you\u2019ve put the wire into the connector. Try to put enough solder on so it covers the outside and goes in between the threads a bit, but do not put too much solder on or else you won\u2019t be able to fit it into the connector. \n\n\t\t\n\n\n\nPut the wire into the connector: Pretty self-explanatory. If it doesn\u2019t fit, you\u2019ve probably used too much solder. Use the desoldering tool to take some off. \n\nSolder: Feed the solder into the connector until the solder has basically filled the entire connector slot like a puddle. Ideally, this is what a perfect solder should look like:\n\n\n\nThe two wires should not touch each other at all.\n\nDon\u2019t forget heat shrink!\n\n\n\nWire to bullet connector\n\nTin the wire: See the second step of part C.\n\nPut the wire into the connector. \n\nSolder: There\u2019s a hole in the bullet connector through which you should feed the solder. Hold the iron up to the bullet connector to warm the metal, which should melt the solder that is tinned on your wire. The solder you add should melt upon touching the warm solder on your wire. \n\n\t\t\n\nWire to power switch\n\nsdfasd\n\n\n\nWire to ring connector\n\nPut heat shrink on your wire! \n\nStrip the wire, and without tinning it, put the wire into the tube at the bottom of the ring connector, as seen in the pictures below. \n\nImportant notes: Make sure you have the correct size ring connector for your wire gauge. Also, make sure your ring connector is not insulated (i.e. it should look like the picture below). \n\nYou should see the wire poking out of the top, but it should not extend beyond the length of the tube. \n\n\t\t\n\nCrimp the ring connector to squish the tube around your wire.

no external gearing\n\nSupporting the other end of the axle is recommended - easy to destroy the motor with impacts\n\nBasically just don't even think about it with an ungeared motor unless you have a very special circumstance (ultra low kV brushless yolodrive???)\n\nBelt/chain drive\n\nSimplest/easiest way to run 4WD off 2 motors, no tensioning needed if done properly\n\nGenerally easy to attach pulleys to a motor shaft\n\nTypically can get no more than 3:1 per stage\n\nTiming belts or chains are often best for 12lb and up as they won't slip, but round belts work great for smaller bots with lower torque\n\nI managed to use O rings in place of welding my own PU belts in Draconid given sufficient stretch/tension, but this can be difficult to size properly\n\nNote: all plain rubber belts lose significant tension over time\n\n3D printing pulleys for belts works extremely well\n\nPlanetary Gearboxes - Pricey but compact and robust\n\nNot good with impact loads, but often beefy output shafts that easily handle shear loads (best to support the axle if you can though)\n\nHandle a ton of torque and very compact for the high ratios\n\nExtremely expensive to get many P60s or Versas, expect $50-90 per drive side in a 12lb+ bot\n\nOften needs an adapter to use brushless, but usually someone has done it before\n\nCan drive a central pulley and belt to 4WD, or drive one wheel directly and belt to second for extra redundancy (see #5)\n\nGears\n\nMetal gears are expensive but 3D printing is a great option (see Draconid)\n\nLess impact tolerant than belts, but can be designed/made to spec\n\nPretty compact, but very restrictive on center-center\n\nUnlike with pulleys/chains, it's not always possible to change ratios without changing center-center\n\n3D printed herringbone gears have a larger root area, stronger tooth profile\n\nNeed 3 gears per side to reverse direction for 2 motor 4WD\n\nSome guesswork can be involved in determining the width and pitch/module needed\n\nCombinations of the above!\n\nNo harm in combining two different approaches, as long as you\u2019re careful\n\nCan get the best of both worlds by combining gears with belts/chains - high reduction with shock isolation\n\nIt can be much cheaper to replace a shaft and pulley than a two stage gearbox\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy Mechanical Components\n\nYou can buy Chain Sprockets, Gears, Pulleys, wheels and more at Andymark, Vex, ServoCity, McMaster, and more!\n\nP60/P80/P61 gearboxes are at Banebots, and Versaplanetary is Vex. \n\nWheels are available from tons of hobby stores, Amazon, Fingertech, Robotshop, several of the above vendors, etc. \n\nAlso take a look on Ebay, Banggood, or other Chinese retailers but YMMV\n\nBrushless motors are available on Amazon, Hobbyking, Banggood, and any drone/RC hobby store\n\nWheels, wheels, wheels!\n\nSofter rubber is more grippy but less durable\n\nFoam tires are able to take direct hits without trashing your bot unlike rubber (see: D2 kit wheels, Fingertech wheels, lite flights)\n\nCustom silicone cast tires are soft and grippy and often the best performing, but require a lot of experimentation, which means a lot of $$$ and time\n\nBe sure to think about how to actually transmit torque to the wheels\n\nLive shaft turning with the wheel\n\nSet screws on flats (Fingertech hubs)\n\nKeyed hubs (Banebots and similar, common for larger bots)\n\nD or Hex shaft/bore, or spline (also Banebots, VEX stuff, Servocity hubs)\n\nDead shaft - axle doesn\u2019t spin\n\nBolt through to pulley/gear (Conduit)\n\nCustom 3D printed things (Draconid)\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nTeam Tentacle torque Calculator: http://runamok.tech/squid/newtorquecalc.htm\n\nAskAaron Drivetrain Gear Ratios Article: http://runamok.tech/AskAaron/optimum.html\n\nBrushless motor torque estimation article\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermining belt lengths\n\n\n\nRequired Prerequisite:\n\nCenter to Center Distance Between Drive Pulleys\n\nEstimate of Drive Pulley Diameter\n\nLater, will need Final Drive Pulley Diameter\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning drive pulleys\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a drive motor and gearbox combo\n\n\n\nUse this drivetrain speccer template\n\n(If you\u2019re designing a spinning weapon, can also use this template)\n\n\n\nSubheading\n\nYou may or may not need this, but here it is just in case. \n\n\n\nEquation Derivations \n\nYou may or may not need this, but here it is just in case. \n\n\n\nTime to top speed (assuming perfect grip) and final speed calculations\n\n\n\nGiven:\n\nPushing Force F [lbf]\n\nBot Mass m [lbm]\n\nMax velocity  [mph]\n\n\n\nSolve:\n\nFor velocity curve over time: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning cleats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesigning a walker\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommended materials",

This is where most of the weight will come from on components. This is useful with TPU, which has a variable flexibility based on how much infill there is.\n\nWalls: Walls are the number of layers between anything touching open air and infill. This is useful to provide a good amount of material for plastite screws to grip in, or to protect the most vulnerable to contact portions of the part.\n\nProfiles: If trying to get a durable part which can hold up under high loads or impacts, selecting Strength Profile will help immensely. Otherwise, Standard profiles will serve just fine.\n\nCommon Issues\n\nThe Filament Isn\u2019t Extruding!\n\nCause: Filament residue or metal fragments are caught in the extruder.\n\nExplanation: The 3D printer is not a perfect system, and because the hot end, or the part where the filament comes out, has such a small hole, residual fragments of filament, or other debris, can clog the hole.\n\nSolution:\n\nRemove the filament from the 3D printer.\n\nTake off the front of the cube that holds the extruder and hot end. It should be held on only by a few magnets.\n\nUse an allen key to remove the two screws which hold the hot end onto the rest of the printer. Do not detach any of the cables.\n\nUse an allen key to remove the fan which is attached to the side of the hot end. Normally, this fan cools the hot end down. Detach the cable which connects the fan to the rest of the printer.\n\nPut on gloves, and turn on the printer and heat the hot end to 250 degrees. This will begin melting any stuck plastic in the printer.\n\nUsing the long, thin needle that comes with the printer, or any needle smaller than the diameter of the opening of the hot end (Typically .4 mm), begin poking through both ends of the hot end to remove any debris.\n\nI\u2019ve found the most effective way to be to poke from the end where the filament is extruded from, and stick it as far through as possible.\n\nRepeat Step 6 until debris cleared and needle has no trace of residue.\n\nReassemble the printer following the above steps in reverse.\n\nNOTE: If printer is still malfunctioning, the hot end may be too clogged to easily remove debris. In this case, repeat the above steps with a new hot end assembly.\n\nResources:\n\nhttps://wiki.bambulab.com/en/x1/maintenance/replace-complete-hotend\n\n\n\nThe Yellow Gear is Clicking and not Spinning!\n\nCause: Hot end or extruder may be jammed, or filament spool may be caught.\n\nExplanation: The yellow gear you can see on the side of the printer head is part of the component which pushes filament through the printer, called the extruder. For a variety of reasons, this gear can get stuck or jammed, and when it clicks and doesn\u2019t move, this can often be your first indication that extruding is failing.\n\nSolution:\n\nRemove filament from the printer.\n\nNOTE: This may not work with just pressing the unload filament button on the printer. If so, try manually removing the filament by pressing in the lever on the side of the printer to cut the filament, and pressing down on the part where the tubing meets the printer head to release the tubing. Throughout this process, you may be able to remove the filament from the printer by pulling manually.\n\nTake off the front of the cube that holds the extruder and hot end. It should be held on only by a few magnets.\n\nUse an allen key to remove the two screws which hold the hot end onto the rest of the printer. Do not detach any of the cables.\n\nAt this point, you may observe the top of the hot end is clogged by a cut piece of filament. If this is the case, follow the instructions above.\n\nIf this is not the case, follow the instructions below.\n\nUse an allen key to remove the extruder assembly from the printer head. This will be the part directly above where the hot end was. You may now detach the cables which connect the hot end to the printer head.\n\nNow with the completely removed extruder, begin disassembling the extruder by removing the plate held on by four screws.\n\nContinue manually disassembling the extruder until a blockage is uncovered.\n\nReassemble extruder and reconnect printer by following the above instructions.\n\nNOTE: If problem persists, the extruder may be \n\nResources:\n\nhttps://wiki.bambulab.com/en/P1/maintenance/extruder-cleaning-guide\n\nhttps://forum.bambulab.com/t/filament-broken-in-extruder/35553\n\n\n\nThe Filament Cutter isn\u2019t Cutting/Is Repeatedly Clicking Or Getting Stuck!\n\nCause: Something is likely jammed in the extruder or is making the extruder not work properly\n\nExplanation: The filament cutter is what cuts the filament so you can remove old filament and put in new filament. Sometimes, debris or filament gets caught in the extruder, which prevents the filament cutter from functioning properly.\n\nSolution:\n\nFollow above steps to disassemble extruder assembly fully.\n\n\n\nI Can\u2019t Load Filament!\n\nCause: Filament tubing improperly aligned/attached to printer head, or skill issue.\n\nExplanation: The clear white tubing is what guides the filament into the printer head from the spool. Occasionally, this will get out of alignment/lose connection to the printer head, which can make loading filament difficult. Occasionally, this can also be a symptom of the above three issues.\n\nSolution:\n\nRemove faceplate from printer head. This should only be held on by a few magnets.\n\nDepress the circular plunger where the tubing/filament enters the top of the printer head. If the tubing is attached, this should release the tubing.\n\nTry loading the filament without the tubing. If this works as expected, depress the plunger again to reattach the tubing.\n\nNOTE: If this step fails, examine the above instructions for a clogged extruder.\n\nReassemble printer following above instructions in reverse.",
