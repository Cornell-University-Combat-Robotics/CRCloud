Brief, informative summary of work done, emphasis on high-level problems and plans for next meeting






















Sensors: 
? Set up the arena 
? Tested the main.py with just the corner detection 
? Seem to work better now
? Realized before our connection to ground on Arduino is loose
? Logically, the code still doesn't seem to work

? Tested using sensor data
? IMU is flip in the bot, so we have to take away the negative
? Sensor itself become super inaccurate with robot drift
? Ex. yaw value goes from 180 to 190 degree within 1 second of move and hitting
? But algorithm and detection seem to behave well 

? Tested with 24-25 algorithm code
? It appears to work better 
? But after clean the wheels, it no longer able to attack the enemies rapidly

? Testing this year's code again

Corner Detection:

Testing:
? auto save should always be on. PLEASE
? image.size / 3 bug in Corner Detection is fixed
? more testing to be done

MechE:
? Everything is ordered
? We need to 3D print
? Most important thing is fixing Bot #2 (the second orange one)
