GITHUB





How to Clone a Repository - SSH



Navigate to the GitHub page of the repository you want to clone and locate the green “<> Code” button

Click on the SSH tab

Copy the SSH url

Go to your laptop’s terminal

“git clone [ssh_url]”





How to Pull Code From Main Branch



To pull code from the main branch when you already have changes locally:

Stash Your Changes: If you have local changes that you want to save for later, use git stash to temporarily store them.

Pull the Latest Code from the Main Branch:

“git pull origin main”

Apply Your Stashed Changes: Once the latest code is pulled, you can reapply your changes by using 

“git stash pop”

Alternatively, if you want to merge your changes with the latest code without stashing, you can use: 

“git pull --rebase origin main”

This will apply your changes on top of the updated main branch, reducing the likelihood of merge conflicts.





How to Commit Code to Local Repository



After making changes, stage your changes for commit using 

“git add <filename> or git add .” (to add all changes) 

Then, commit with a descriptive message:

 “git commit -m "your descriptive message"

Remember to always write **clear and concise** commit messages that describe the change in the code.



Note: “git commit -a -m "your descriptive message" combines “git add .” and “git commit -m "your descriptive message"





How to Resolve Merge Conflicts 



Git cannot resolve differences between two separate commits.



Types of Merge Conflicts:

Edit Conflict

Delete-Edit Conflict 

Content Conflict



You can resolve merge conflicts by:

Editing the file

Stashing changes

git stash

git pull

git stash pop

Merge editor

Add files and commit the change

How to Use Branches



*Branches allow you to work on new features or bug fixes separately from the main codebase. 



Always create a new branch for each feature or fix

“git branch <new-branch-name>”

“git checkout -b <new-branch-name>”

“git switch -c <new-branch-name>”



Once the work is complete, merge it back to the main branch.

“git checkout main”

“git merge <completed-branch-name>”



Note: To keep the branches organized, you should always delete a branch once you finished implementing a feature and undergo code review, or successfully implement and fully test a fix to a bug



How to Delete a Branch



Locally: 

git branch -d <branch-name> safe delete 

git branch -D <branch-name> force delete



Remotely:

git push origin --delete <branch-name>



How to Switch to Existing Branches



“git switch <existing-branch>”

“git checkout <existing branch>”











GOOD CODING PRACTICES





Naming Conventions



Here are the criteria that make a good commit message:

The first line is less than 50 characters, with the first one capitalized. The words complete the sentence "If you pulled this commit into your own copy of the repo, this commit would..." You are informing the reader what value they are getting from your commit.

The second line is blank.

The remaining lines supply details.



Variables: snake_case

Functions: snake_case()

Classes: PascalCase

Constants: ALL_CAPS





Always Work in GitHub Branches How-to: Code & GitHub



*Avoid working directly in the main branch. Create a new branch for each task, allowing others to review changes before merging into the main codebase.





Update README.md Often 



*The README.md should provide an overview of the project, setup instructions, and any relevant information on usage. Keep it updated, especially when new features are added.





GitHub Pull Before Pushing How-to: Code & GitHub



*Always run git pull before pushing changes to ensure your local code is up-to-date with the remote repository. This helps prevent conflicts and potential merge conflicts.





Classes



Use classes to encapsulate related functions and data, especially for larger projects. Each class should have a single responsibility.





Global Constants/Variables



Global Constants and variables are values defined at the top of a file. We should use them because it makes it easier to modify values and results in cleaner code. We should use them anytime we have to hardcode a value





Environments



An environment is a directory containing a collection of software tools and installed packages. The benefit of using environments is it would prevent package collision errors. Install Conda → environment management system



venv commands:

python -m venv <directory>

source <directory>/bin/activate | venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

deactivate

rm -r <directory>



Conda Commands: 

conda create --name <environment name>

conda activate <environment name>

conda deactivate

conda env list

Lists all of your environments

conda list

See which packages are installed in your current environment

Use pip to install python packages once you’re on your environment





Setup.sh



A setup script (setup.sh) can automate the setup process, installing necessary packages and configuring the environment. Use this to streamline the project setup for new contributors.





.gitignore



The “.gitignore” file specifies files and directories that should not be tracked by Git (e.g., sensitive data, large binary files, and local configuration files). Be sure to keep it updated.





Requirements.txt



A requirements.txt file lists all necessary packages for a Python project.











GIT COMMAND CHEAT SHEET



git status →  lists your branch, commit status, and more

git pull →  pulls from main

git add <filename> / git add -A / git add . → adds changes to staging area

git commit -m “commit message” → commits things in staging area locally

git push → pushed local commit to global repository

git checkout <branch name> [git checkout main, git checkout test_code] → switches branch

git branch <new branch name> → creates new branch

git help →  Gives a list of useful git commands

git restore <file> → Reverts changes and “restores” previous version of the file(s)

git rm <file> → Removes file from the working directory. Calling git add, git commit, git push will push the current working directory and remove file from the repo.

git stash → Stashes changes away (can be recovered), and provides a clean working directory.

git stash pop → Pops most recent stash back into the working directory
