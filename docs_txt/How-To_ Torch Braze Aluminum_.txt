Helpful Video

This video will explain everything you need to know, but if you’re too lazy to watch it, you can read the directions below. 

Materials

You can get all of these materials at Home Depot or Amazon:

Propane Torch 

Torch Trigger

Aluminum brazing and welding rods

Aluminum Tubing

Steps

*Note: When brazing, the filler rod will always flow towards the heat. Had you clamped your setup vertically and gotten the joint a fair bit hotter, you could have drawn the molten filler towards the torch. could make for a significantly stronger joint.



*Note: For better results, work on a ceramic topped table with a ceramic tile behind the metal you're working on. Try to place ceramic on the sides also. This will reflect a good portion of heat which will otherwise dissipate very quickly.



Chamfer the ends of the aluminum where you are going to bond it (to allow a channel for the braising material)

Clean the aluminum with a brush

Clamp up the tubing

Start heating the intended area with the propane torch (get it to around 700 degrees)

This may take 4-5 minutes

We want it hot enough to melt the brazing rod but not the aluminum

When you think you’ve reached that point start moving the rod down the chamfered channel and when it starts to melt you are hot enough 

Rub the brazing rod until its filled in then finish off with some heat

Repeat process on all sides of the aluminum joint
