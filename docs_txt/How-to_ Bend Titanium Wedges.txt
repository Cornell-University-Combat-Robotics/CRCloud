How to bend titanium wedges

Notes about titanium bending

In order to achieve a certain bend angle, you have to overshoot your goal angle by about 15°. From there, the titanium will bend backward to the spot that you want it to be in. 

Titanium will break if you try to bend it to about 45°. Be sure to follow the procedure below carefully. 

The procedure outlined in Step 4 below will increase the bend radius, therefore making the plate less susceptible to breaking. (Bigger radius = less stress concentration—remember statics?)

Procedure

All sheet metal bending is done using the sheet metal bender in the Emerson machine shop, which is to your left when you enter the shop.

Clamp your titanium plate onto the machine. 

For bends smaller than 45°:

Bend to whatever angle you want + about 15 extra degrees. 

Done!

For bends at or greater than 45°:

Bend titanium to no more than 55°.

Unclamp and pull the titanium out a few millimeters. 

Re-clampe the plate and bend again.

Repeat until the desired angle is achieved. 

Done!
