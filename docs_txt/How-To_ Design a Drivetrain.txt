Drive Calculation Spreadsheet: https://bit.ly/JustCuzDriveCalc

For the calculator you need to know the # of wheels, # of motors, wheel diameter, and motor specs

Main parameters that determine the needed motor/gearing

Weight class (how much weight can be dedicated to drive?)

Drive Strategy - control, wedge, or other?

Speed is actually a lower priority for a control bot than a vertical spinner - spinners need to achieve good bite and escape from a bad position

Pushing power/low end torque are critical for control bots, especially w/o wedges

Generally a wedge, lifter, grabber, or other control bot will want more drive power than a spinner

Determining how much drive power is needed is a function of the desired speed and torque for your chosen wheels

According to Ask Aaron’s drivetrain guidelines, you will want at least 1.5-2X the torque required to spin the robot wheels to prevent stalling/overloading the motor while pushing an opponent into or against a wall. 

Note: More torque with a reasonable top speed >> stupid fast top speed

Having the ability to go 100mph if you only have room to accelerate to 20mph means leaving lots of torque on the table

Combat arenas are small - acceleration and pushing power is often far more important than speed, and both are only related to torque and traction

Transferring Power to Wheels - Mechanics and Reductions

Direct drive:

Prosoften risky and fragile, but very simple; no external gearing

Supporting the other end of the axle is recommended - easy to destroy the motor with impacts

Basically just don't even think about it with an ungeared motor unless you have a very special circumstance (ultra low kV brushless yolodrive???)

Belt/chain drive

Simplest/easiest way to run 4WD off 2 motors, no tensioning needed if done properly

Generally easy to attach pulleys to a motor shaft

Typically can get no more than 3:1 per stage

Timing belts or chains are often best for 12lb and up as they won't slip, but round belts work great for smaller bots with lower torque

I managed to use O rings in place of welding my own PU belts in Draconid given sufficient stretch/tension, but this can be difficult to size properly

Note: all plain rubber belts lose significant tension over time

3D printing pulleys for belts works extremely well

Planetary Gearboxes - Pricey but compact and robust

Not good with impact loads, but often beefy output shafts that easily handle shear loads (best to support the axle if you can though)

Handle a ton of torque and very compact for the high ratios

Extremely expensive to get many P60s or Versas, expect $50-90 per drive side in a 12lb+ bot

Often needs an adapter to use brushless, but usually someone has done it before

Can drive a central pulley and belt to 4WD, or drive one wheel directly and belt to second for extra redundancy (see #5)

Gears

Metal gears are expensive but 3D printing is a great option (see Draconid)

Less impact tolerant than belts, but can be designed/made to spec

Pretty compact, but very restrictive on center-center

Unlike with pulleys/chains, it's not always possible to change ratios without changing center-center

3D printed herringbone gears have a larger root area, stronger tooth profile

Need 3 gears per side to reverse direction for 2 motor 4WD

Some guesswork can be involved in determining the width and pitch/module needed

Combinations of the above!

No harm in combining two different approaches, as long as you’re careful

Can get the best of both worlds by combining gears with belts/chains - high reduction with shock isolation

It can be much cheaper to replace a shaft and pulley than a two stage gearbox



Where to Buy Mechanical Components

You can buy Chain Sprockets, Gears, Pulleys, wheels and more at Andymark, Vex, ServoCity, McMaster, and more!

P60/P80/P61 gearboxes are at Banebots, and Versaplanetary is Vex. 

Wheels are available from tons of hobby stores, Amazon, Fingertech, Robotshop, several of the above vendors, etc. 

Also take a look on Ebay, Banggood, or other Chinese retailers but YMMV

Brushless motors are available on Amazon, Hobbyking, Banggood, and any drone/RC hobby store

Wheels, wheels, wheels!

Softer rubber is more grippy but less durable

Foam tires are able to take direct hits without trashing your bot unlike rubber (see: D2 kit wheels, Fingertech wheels, lite flights)

Custom silicone cast tires are soft and grippy and often the best performing, but require a lot of experimentation, which means a lot of $$$ and time

Be sure to think about how to actually transmit torque to the wheels

Live shaft turning with the wheel

Set screws on flats (Fingertech hubs)

Keyed hubs (Banebots and similar, common for larger bots)

D or Hex shaft/bore, or spline (also Banebots, VEX stuff, Servocity hubs)

Dead shaft - axle doesn’t spin

Bolt through to pulley/gear (Conduit)

Custom 3D printed things (Draconid)
