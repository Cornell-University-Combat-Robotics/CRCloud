- Next time:
- Scale with frame rate
- Live test
- Use the huey image even without orientation
- Go through algo (ex. Huey danger zone)
- Orientation can now be None, while other Huey attributes exist
- Test check_desired_speed_and_turn: Does orientation default to 0.0, or save last orient? (line 239)
