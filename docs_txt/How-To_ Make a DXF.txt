How to make a DXF



A DXF file (Drawing Exchange Format file) is a vector file that’s used to share drawing data between different applications. A DXF file is needed for the following 2D manufacturing methods: 

Laser cutting

Water jetting

For more information on 2D manufacturing, see How-To: Design for different manufacturing methods.

Let’s say I have this part that I would like to get manufactured from SendCutSend: 





Make a projected sketch

Click on the face that the laser (or water jet) will be cutting into (i.e. the face with the important geometry). 



Hit ‘Create Sketch’. 

Hit ‘P’ on your keyboard to activate the ‘Project’ feature. 

Click on the same face you selected before and hit ‘OK’. 

You should see a sketch of the face in purple. 



Select ‘Finish Sketch’. 



IMPORTANT NOTE: Everywhere you see a purple line is where the laser (or water jet) will cut. If your sketch contains a line that goes through the part (like the picture below) then your part will be cut into 2 pieces! Always double check your sketch to make sure that it only contains lines that you want cut, and that it is not missing any important features. 





Save the sketch as a DXF

Right click your sketch in the browser on the left. 

Rename your sketch to ‘DXF’ so that others know what the sketch is for. 



Right click on ‘DXF’ and select ‘Save as DXF’.



Save the sketch wherever you’d like with a name that makes sense. 



You’re done!
