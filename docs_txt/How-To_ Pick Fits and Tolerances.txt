How to pick tolerances



Perhaps put a little blurb here explaining why this document exists, or any other references that people can refer to. 



Heading 1

Your very first section! Congrats! Make sure to include pictures and be as specific as possible while not over-blabbing. (By the way, make sure to tell Anna you’re writing this so she can proof-read it when you’re done!)



Also, try to not use paragraphs as much as possible. 

The easier it is to read, the more likely someone will be to read it. 



Subheading

You may or may not need this, but here it is just in case. 

If you’re listing steps

to do something, 

then maybe using a 

numbered list

might be helpful!

Maybe even substeps too…



Heading 2

In case you need another one…who knows!





SLIP FIT- WITHIN 1 THOU ON GREATER END OF BEARING SIZE GIVEN BEARING TOLERANCE

	Smaller bearing- 1 thou may be too large

	Lower limit: largest bearing size, Highest limit: 1 thou above that 

Press fit if you are comfortable with part never coming again
