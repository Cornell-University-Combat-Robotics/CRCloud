How to Ansys



Downloading ANSYS

Link to Student Ansys download

There are a few different free versions of Ansys, but this is the most versatile and will probably suit your needs just fine. 

Make sure you have enough space on your computer beforehand, or it won’t finish the download. 

After download, you want to open the Ansys Workbench. If you have some trouble finding it, this forum question might help. 



Subheading

You may or may not need this, but here it is just in case. 

If you’re listing steps

to do something, 

then maybe using a 

numbered list

might be helpful!

Maybe even substeps too…



Random Notes to be organized later

Start from the Workbench

Fluid Flow → Geometry → DesignModeler

C-shape domain converges better than an oval-shaped domain

Create domain in a sketch → turn sketch to lines → turn lines into surface → turn solid surface into fluid surface

This surface represents the fluid surface

Need to split domain into faces to make the mesh software work easier

Workbench → Mesh → Mechanical

Want smaller edges near the airfoil (subject)

First cell height thickness

First cell height at a y+ of 1 (to capture nonlinearity of flow near the surface)

Need to pick a Reynolds number for the flow

Re → mainstream velocity [m/s] → use this link to get y+ (shown as delta s here)

If your cell height is less than this value, you’re good

This will vary across the wall; make sure you check it after the simulation

Boundary conditions

Setup

Make Polyhedral has better convergence quality
