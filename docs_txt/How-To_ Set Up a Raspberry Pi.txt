Setting up Raspberry Pi on a newly bought Pi

Flashing (for a brand new Pi) 

If newly bought, the Pi is just empty, so you need to download the OS to start using it:

Get an adapter that can connect the SD card (typically an empty one)  to the desired device 

Download the Raspberry Pi Imager OS (official website) 

The screen should appear then Select the device and the image model 

The image model could be either from an SD card that was stored on your computer or the following OS provided 



Once you have selected the options, press next and wait for the imager to finish writing 

Once completed, remove the SD card and put it into the desired Raspberry Pi then plug in the power supply

The Pi should be on and would need to be hooked up to a monitor (needs a dongle for HDMI), mouse and keyboard

Pi should start booting up and display on the screen 

YAY, you successfully started up a Pi now go be a menace 

Imagining and Writing 

Similar to copying the information from a previous SD (imaging), which can either be pasted on a

new or used pi (writing) 



Imagining (either from a previous or new Pi) 

Reading (for Windows)

Take the SD card from a current pi and connect it to your laptop 

Download the Win32DiskImager

The following page should show up

(To confirm if the SD is in, under “device” it should show random symbols)

 

Select the folder button in the “image file” box, create a file, and save

Return to the page and select “Read”

Estimated time should take within minutes or less than an hour 

*if hour >1 select cancel, issue I’m not sure of (ask Sebastian) 



Writing (Putting information from a previous SD onto a new SD card) 

Follow the “Imaging” direction to have the copy of the previous SD card file that you want to have write on a new SD

Take the new SD you want to write over and plug it into the computer with the file

Open Win32DiskImager 

In the “Image File” click the folder icon and select the Image of the previous SD 

Select “Write” to start copying over the information to the new SD

Once the file is complete you have identical SD cards and you can use it how you see fit, Yay!



Software Configuration for Remote Access

On-board Pi Information

Connect the Pi to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse

Connect the Pi to the RedRover network (more steps involved, but I forgot, sorry -Ethan)

After connecting successfully to the network, the IP address will pop up briefly

Otherwise, to access the IP address:

Open the terminal

Type ifconfig

You should see a terminal output with three sections; under the last section, labelled wlan0, write down the IP address following inet, which should have the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

In the terminal, type sudo raspi-config

Navigate to “Interface Options”, then “VNC”, and press “Yes” to enable VNC.



On Your Computer: Windows

On your computer now, be sure you have RealVNC installed

RealVNC might prompt you to make an account; simply continue to the account creation, then press cancel

In the top bar, enter the IP address previously saved

When prompted, use the current Raspberry Pi credentials to sign into the Pi

NOTE: Although multiple users can connect to the Pi remotely, they are all functionally controlling the same computer; thus, operations performed by one user will be reflected across all connected devices.

NOTE: The IP address is also liable to change after turning off and on again, so if connection fails, double check you have the right IP address
