# CRChat
CRChat is a simple chatbot that utilizes the RAG frame and the `langchain_ollama` library and a language model (Llama 3) to answer questions in a conversational manner. This bot maintains a conversation history and uses it to provide contextually relevant answers.

## Features

- Conversational history tracking for context-based responses.
- Simple prompt template for customizing question-answer format.
- Terminal interface for interactive chat.

1. Build the RAG model with simple knowledge base
Refer to Local Development & llm_chatbot.py 
    Learn about Retrievable - Augmented - Generation 
    Building off of llm_chatbot.py(or start from scratch), starting with by connect with a simple txt file

2. Getting the RAG model to connect to Google Drive & interface with the users
    Connect LLM to our google drive, except for security-related docs(i.e. member info sheet)
    Building a configuration that would take google drive knowledge base to our RAG code
    Some initial ideas of user interaction includes slack apps and website assistant

Reasons of not using AWS right now: 
- It is expensive if we don't know how to properly configure the services in AWS(even if we optimize the cost, it still could be very COSTLY)
- Google Drive virtually acheives the exact storage requirements for us, and it's free and easy to use

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `langchain_ollama` and `langchain_core` libraries

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine or create a new Python file with the code.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary libraries:
